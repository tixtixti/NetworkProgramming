Functon are defined as:

int stat(const char *filename, struct stat *buf);
int lstat(const char *filename, struct stat *buf);
int fstat(int filedesc, struct stat *buf);

Where filename and filedesc are filneme or file descriptor of file.
and where struct stat *buf is struct where returning data is saved.

struct contains:
st_dev – identifier of device containing file
st_ino – inode number
st_mode – protection mode; see also Unix permissions
st_nlink – reference count of hard links
st_uid – user identifier of owner
st_gid – group identifier of owner
st_rdev – device identifier (if special file)
st_size – total file size, in bytes
st_atime – time of last access
st_mtime – time of last modification
st_ctime – time of last status change
st_blksize – preferred block size for file system I/O, which can depend upon both the system and the type of file system[3]
st_blocks – number of blocks allocated in multiples of DEV_BSIZE (usually 512 bytes).
